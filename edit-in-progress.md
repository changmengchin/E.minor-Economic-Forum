The bubble without any fizz

### 資產價格創記錄新高

##### 為什麼大家不恐慌

- 所有資產齊漲，無法指出那些資產有泡沬問題

##### 資產價格過度上漲的證據

- 循環性調整後的本益比（CAPE）創新高  
  買一串的廠商收益變得越來越貴。

- 房地產價格：美國已回到2008次貸危機前的高水位，也超過長期價格／租金平均水準。

##### 資產價格過度上漲的問題
- 已上漲的資產投報率下降，投資者只好找尋其他風險更高（但價格還可以）的資產；資產風險無法充份反應在資產價格上。

    - 風險性債券（如新興市場的美元債）與無風險債券（如美國國庫券）的殖利率差距縮小（credit spread）  
    
    - 目前長期利率水準也偏低，消費者開始找尋其他較能保有購買力的資產。
    
      An interest rate is the reward for forgoing spending today, to consume tomorrow. When the desire to spend today’s income tomorrow increases, interest rates fall. That makes people keen to find other ways of storing their spending power—and thus more willing to pay more for other assets


##### 為什麼長期利率水準偏低

- 三個原因：儲蓄意願上升、經濟上的結構性變化、中央銀行的政策

儲蓄意願上升：

- 先進國家人口老化。

- 中國高儲蓄率，在和國際拉軌後，增加大量的儲蓄能量。

經濟上的結構性變化：

- 廠房設備的實質成本下降減少資金需求。

- 科技產業不再高度依存廠房設備投資，而多投資在無形資產上（後者成本相對上也低）。

中央銀行的政策：

- short-term interest rates have been kept low for a long time

- an attempt to push investors into riskier assets, thus ginning up the economy

- Central banks are as much shaped by economic trends as shapers of them

- If the central banks were really keeping interest rates and bond yields too low, the economy would overheat and inflation would take off. There is not much evidence of this

- In the absence of inflation it is reasonable to expect low interest rates to persist, and thus unsurprising that the prices of stocks, corporate bonds and property go up

- If the yields on risk-free bonds stay depressed, then the expected returns on all other assets—the earnings yields on equities, say, or the rental yield on houses—must fall into line.

- If the real interest rate is lower and looks likely to stay that way, discount rates will fall, too. That makes future earnings more valuable, and goes some way to justifying paying a high price for them.

- What if, for instance, inflation is sending a false signal about where real interest rates should be?

- If that were the case, central banks might indeed be keeping rates lower than they ought to.

- entral banks steer by the inflation rate as mariners steer by their compasses. If it rises, the economy is overheating and the ship must adjust its trim. If it falls, the economy needs a dose of monetary stimulus; the sails must be unfurled. The problem, Mr Borio says, is that the compass no longer reads true.

- Globalisation, the decline of union power and technological change mean that inflation does not perk up when the jobless rate falls in quite the way it used to; the short-term trade-off between inflation and the unemployment rate, known as the Phillips Curve, has weakened to the point of breakdown

- a decade of aggressively loose monetary policy may well have weighed down bond-market rates—and thus, for a while at least, people’s idea of the neutral real rate

- What does this mean for the future? One possibility is that the spiral may go into reverse as central banks

- Hyun Song Shin of the BIS recently warned of the perils of a possible “snapback” in global bond yields if, for instance, some investors start dumping bonds as yields rise, just as they snapped them up as yields fell. The prices of other assets, such as stocks, might also lose support. Indeed, the prices of other assets might be more destabilised than those in the bond markets themselves.

- to tighten will be made more vexed by indications that the increased propensity for saving, is itself in the process of turning round. China’s current-account surplus (a measure of its excess saving) narrowed from 10% of GDP in 2007 to under 2% of GDP in 2016.

- Who should worry about this? One view is that, because stockmarket booms tend to end badly, policymakers should take deliberate action now to deflate prices before it is too late.

- For some tastes, this comes close to arguing that the Fed has to destroy the recovery in order to save it; the steep rise in the federal funds rate required to bring American share prices to earth might tip the economy into recession

- the stockmarket is a sideshow. Hardly any capital is allocated with reference to stock values, since IPOs are so scarce. What matters to the economy are banks and (in America, at least) credit markets.

- when the mood in credit markets is bullish (ie, corporate-bond spreads are unusually narrow and the share of junk-bond issuance high), the economy will soon suffer, with an abrupt tightening of credit and slower growth.

- “I’m wary of targeting inflation so aggressively that you are not mindful of the risks from bullish sentiment.”

- The least—and perhaps the best—that can be done is to ensure that the real economy is protected should prices suddenly fall. That means guarding against purchases made with too much borrowed money of illiquid assets, especially property

- ensuring banks have enough capital to withstand a correction in asset prices
